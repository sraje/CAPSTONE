###Howard's comments
When should our app “Forget” data. Privacy issue when adding users to a group, so maybe we should delete by default.
Joel: Scale based on the number of people using the application.Possibly set a hard limit on the number of rides saved per user.

Should we drop the Parse service and implement a custom backend? Howard says we should not drop it immediately, but instead have good unit tests to make sure the backend is solid.

###What we're currently working on
 A user facing application that will interface with the BikeSmart system. This is the main goal of this quarter.
 
###Other Updates
`Sim cards will possibly come later, but this isn’t currently blocking us.
