####Goals for this quarter
Take a "first whack" at getting a bike ready for the Internet of Things

 - Get a wireless device on a bike. Regulate battery usage and connectivity so that the device can remain "alive" for an extended period of time
 - Publish data from the device and read from other devices
 
####Minimum deliverable
Have the service, show that it works, and be able to maintain the service through various circumstances.

 
####Stretch Goal
Service running on the phone itself. Have P2P communication with sensors on bike. David thinks that adding sensors onto the bike is definitely within the scope of this project.

#### Other Questions and Thoughts
 - *Are we focusing on creating a backend platform from scratch, or is the focus more on the top level applications like "Find my Bike"?*  
 	- Focus on the connectivity and service up and running. Demonstrate this via an application. 	 	
- *To whom does this project belong? Should our repository be public or private?*
	- Github repository: Public
	- David recommends we use a BSD license on everything we write.  
- *Meeting time with David?*
	- Free during working hours, except Thursdays are not easy.  
- Database implementation? 
	- Use whatever will get us done quickly. David prefers we stay away from web services and look more into P2P services.
- Android App is an option, but not required. A PC application that can process data from sensors is acceptable
- Thoughts on applications: fitness, "guided tour", and keyless bike lock
- Users: sport, everyday, commuter, bike tour
