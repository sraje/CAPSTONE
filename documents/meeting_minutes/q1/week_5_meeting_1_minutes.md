####What we finished over weekend
 - Basic working location services
 	- Get location
 	- Stores location
 	- Ability to create specific accounts for users. Accounts verified through parse service.
 	
####What we're working on this week
 - Create separate application with user interface to provide better example of services to user
 - Location data stored on the phone and work on pushing data to server at intervals
 
####Geoloqi API
 - Doesn't exactly fit with our use case, so we may look into mimicking some of this API's "added services" 
 - Proprietary data-store feature built in, if we were to look into this option.
 
####Peripherals
 - Joel contacted bluetooth sensor company, waiting on their response.
 - We will likely end up moving this to next quarter and looking into a "home-brew" solution with our own sensors.
